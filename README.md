# Portfolio-Optimization-in-Python

Developed a portfolio optimization model using Python to identify the optimal asset allocation for maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
- defined securities and time range
- imported adjusted close prices
- calculated daily returns (lognormal)
- calculated the covariance matrix 
- calculated optimal weights, expected return and standard deviation of the portfolio
- calculated the Sharpe Ratio and retrieved the risk free rate from the FRED API
- set the initial weights and constraints
- found the weights in the optimal portfolio
- displayed the optimal portfolio results
